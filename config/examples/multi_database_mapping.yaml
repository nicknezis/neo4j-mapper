# Multi-database mapping example
# This example shows how to map data from multiple separate databases
#
# IMPORTANT: Column Naming After JOINs
# When JOINs are performed, columns are automatically prefixed with database aliases
# to prevent name collisions (e.g., "id" becomes "hr_id", "pm_id").
# In your field mappings, use the original column names - the system will automatically
# resolve them to the correct prefixed columns.

databases:
  - path: "data/hr_system.db"
    alias: "hr"
  - path: "data/project_management.db"
    alias: "pm"
  - path: "data/time_tracking.db"
    alias: "time"

mappings:
  - name: "employee_projects"
